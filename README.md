NOTE: currently the server is hardcoded, im changing this once i get setting storage setup so you dont have to enter it every time you launch the app

## todo
- [ ] multiple channels
- [ ] commands (/join, /msg, etc)
- [ ] setting storage for server/user config
- [ ] improve UI

## cia export
run `./cia.sh` to build a cia file, you will need `makerom` and `bannertool` installed and in your PATH
